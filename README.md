# Database Systems Final Project

## Goal
Our goal was to make a fake potion sales application. We created the database of potions, customers, etc in MySQL, the API to access the database in Node.JS, and the front-end client in python. The main purpose of the project was to demonstrate our proficency in SQL, which was what the class was based around.

### Instruction to Run

Starting the API:

`npm install` then `nodemon api.js sunapee`

Running the Client:

`python3 client.py`
